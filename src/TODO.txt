      }
      Make sure registration takes user straight to input.
}

SUBMISSION BUTTONS NEED TO BE STANDARDISED.

CREATE THE MOBILE RESOLUTION --> {
      Everything needs to be adaptive.
      All the pages need to be moved around for that.

}

CSS THE IMAGE SUBMIT DROP DOWNS -->{
      Maybe stack them vertically.
}

ADD IN CODE AND DATABASE TABLES FOR THE OTHER RACES -->{
      Also need to actually add more races.
}

DO THE SAME FOR THE ROLES.

MAKE THE SIDEBAR MORE RESPONSIVE, AND THAT BUTTONS LINE UP VERTICALLY BETTER.

IMAGE PREVIEW IMAGE -->{
         Needs to be sized and positioned properly.
         Make a little larger.
         Make sure user can change mind and select different image -->{
               Button text should change to reflect that.
         }
}

GIVE USER WAY TO SAVE FAVOURITE CHARACTERS -->{
      Add them to their homepage. 
      Saves all data, user can them effectivly gen a char with those reponses all ready.
